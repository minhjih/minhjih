## Researches 📚

### RT-AUGGAN: Robust Fingerprint Positioning under Environmental Variations via Ray Tracing-Assisted GAN Augmentation - [ACCEPTED](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11263604) IEEE/IEIE ICCE-ASIA 2025 
RT-AugGAN is a novel framework that bridges digital-twin ray tracing and deep generative modeling to create physically meaningful channel augmentation for wireless communication systems.

## Hackerthon & Competition

### 🎖️ Chung Ju-yung Startup Competition [reveal](https://github.com/minhjih/dailyexp) ([Link](https://reveal.ac))
Glimpse is an innovative research tracking and knowledge sharing platform designed for graduate students. It offers a comprehensive solution for receiving recommendations on the latest papers in your field of interest, capturing key insights, sharing them with your research group, and publicly posting your paper reviews to spread knowledge in a short-form.

@jadestar and I joined to Chung Ju-yung Startup Competition with this idea.


### 🥈 Science Hackathon-SPARCS [ScienSnap](https://github.com/joon363/STdev_BREMEN)
일상 속 궁금한 장면을 카메라로 찍기만 하면,  해당 장면과 연결된 과학 개념을 쉽고 재미있게 알려줘요
학년별 주제, 과목별 분류, 등급별로 정리되며  하나하나 채워갈수록 나만의 과학 도감이 완성됩니다
내가 수집한 과학 카드들은 주간 랭킹에 자동 반영돼요. 누가 더 많이, 더 희귀한 개념을 모았는지 확인할 수 있어요

### AI Consensus AI Hackathon Seoul[UpDocs](https://github.com/joon363/StudentsAI_BREMEN)
This project was developed as part of the AGI Agent Application Hackathon. It aims to solve the bottlenecks students, researchers, and new employees face in writing high-quality structured documents without sufficient feedback or reference materials.

### 🥇🏆 2025 AWS Blackout Team BREMEN [GARi](https://github.com/minhjih/Blackout2025)
We propose a mobility app incorporating gamified elements inspired by popular games like "Pokémon GO" and "Pikmin Bloom." The app includes an AI-based safety driving score system, rewarding users with discounts for safe driving and proper parking. A ranking system further encourages competition among users. This approach aims to enhance the safety of shared mobility and improve its social perception. Bremen is track winner of Gcoo track and overall winner of AWS Blackout Hackerthon.

### 🥉 DataEn OIBC-2024 BIG Data Challenge [Bremen](https://competition.postech.ac.kr/%ea%b3%b5%ec%a7%80%ec%82%ac%ed%95%ad/?uid=250&mod=document&pageid=1)
A hybrid model combining RNN, SARIMA, and Transformer architectures was developed to provide a predictive solution for the Jeju electricity market. The model demonstrated exceptional stability in its performance, earning a prestigious third-place award.

### 2024 Junction Asia [Mamma](https://github.com/minhjih/JUNCTIONBREMEN)
Momma is the Full stacked application which gives Food information and automatically examining nutrient information for pregnant women The service gives information about nutrients powered by customed AI. Based on eaten foods’ information, user can manage and check their nutrients information in targetting period. Not only providing nutrient from food image, but also analyzing information of delivery food from image, they can easily access to the delivery food with confidence in health information.

## Side Projects
### [Chameleon](https://github.com/minhjih/Chameleon) IDE 🦎 
Chameleon runs LLMs locally by default, eliminating external data exposure.
Developers can generate task-specific datasets(with RAG) and fine-tune models directly within the IDE.
This enables reproducible AI-assisted development for security-critical and domain-specific codebases.

### 🌱 AI-based Operating System [AINUX](https://github.com/minhjih/Ainux)
Why Not Vibe OS? AI will schedule your operating system. It might cause disaster sometimes, but that might be surprise event! 😱

## HONORS
KEPCO Academic Scholarship, Korea Electric Power Corporation (2023)
Selected as a national scholarship recipient based on academic excellence and potential in the energy sector.
