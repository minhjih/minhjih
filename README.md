### About
Personal Mobility (PM) refers to individual transportation devices such as electric scooters and bicycles, offering convenience and eco-friendliness. Shared mobility services enable multiple users to access these devices, with examples like GCOO in South Korea. However, safety concerns and parking issues remain significant challenges.

To address these problems, we propose a mobility app incorporating gamified elements inspired by popular games like "Pokémon GO" and "Pikmin Bloom." The app includes an AI-based safety driving score system, rewarding users with discounts for safe driving and proper parking. A ranking system further encourages competition among users. This approach aims to enhance the safety of shared mobility and improve its social perception.
